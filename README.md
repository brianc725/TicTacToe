# TicTacToe
A text based game of Tic Tac Toe using C++ coded from scratch.

When the program is run, it will begin by prompting for two names for the players. The turns alternate as in a normal game of Tic Tac Toe, with Player 1 going first, followed by Player 2, and back to Player 1. 

The position that you would like to mark is entered by typing in the number of the spot you wish to place your marker. 

The game automatically ends when there is a winner or if the board is full, resulting in a tie.
