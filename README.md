# TicTacToe
A text based game of Tic Tac Toe using C++ coded from scratch.

To run, download the repo and unzip the folder. 

Using command line, change directory to TicTacToe/DerivedData/TicTacToe/Build/Products/Debug/
Once inside of the directory, run program with ./TicTacToe

The program will now run, prompting for two names for the players. The turns alternate as in a normal game of Tic Tac Toe,
with Player 1 going first, followed by Player 2, and back to Player 1. 

The position that you would like to mark is entered by typing in the number of the spot you wish to place your marker. 

The game automatically ends when there is a winner or if the board is full, resulting in a tie.
